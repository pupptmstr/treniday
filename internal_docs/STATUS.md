# TreniDay — Status

> Part of the project notes — the index is [README.md](README.md). Updated with every branch.

**Version:** 0.9.11 on branch `session/2026-10-17-progress-export` (the progress file: save it, add one from another device, merged), waiting for the owner's go. `main` has 0.9.10. The owner keeps the version at 0.9.x until they call it 1.0.

## What the app has

| Courses | Calisthenics, Healthy Body, Evening Stretch, Morning Routine, Yoga, own courses; 24 branches (4 outside the courses) — [courses.md](reference/courses.md) |

| Game | SP, streaks and freezes, ranks with decay, 45 achievements, challenges with Skala, five course hosts — [progression.md](reference/progression.md) |
| Workout | hands-free holds (get-ready, sides), 21 sound cues, time estimate at the user's pace — [workout.md](reference/workout.md) |

## Waiting for the owner (v1.0 blockers)

- **Apple ID in Xcode** (Settings → Accounts) so automatic signing registers the App IDs, the App Group and HealthKit for a real device; then the paid Apple Developer Program and the Google Play Console for the stores. A new personal Play account must run a **closed test with at least 12 testers opted in for 14 days in a row** before it may apply for production access — the longest step. **Plan (owner, 2026-10-13):** iOS and the web first; Android once 12 testers gather by themselves (the Google Group [treniday-testers](https://groups.google.com/g/treniday-testers), invited from the site's FAQ and from About in the web version on Android phones, 0.9.10; no paid testers, no advertising) — [decisions](decisions/README.md#ios-and-the-web-first-android-when-the-testers-gather-owner-2026-10-13). The release CI is drafted and disabled until then ([platform.md § Release builds](reference/platform.md#release-builds-ci--drafted-disabled)).
- **Native proofreading** of German and Spanish — the app and the site (`site/strings/de.json`, `es.json`) — and the store listings (`fastlane/metadata/de-DE`, `es-ES`, `android/de-DE`, `android/es-ES`; the legal pages stay English only).
- **The store listings — ready for review** (merged 2026-10-13): the texts of both stores in four languages in `fastlane/metadata/` (within every limit: `tools/store/check_listing.py`), the answers for App Privacy, Data safety, the age ratings, the Health declarations and export compliance, and the screenshot plan — [specs/store-listing.md](specs/store-listing.md). The native settings the stores check on upload are done in 0.9.10, and 1.0 is iPhone only (owner); the screenshots are not made yet.
- **The name, optionally:** a word mark "TreniDay" in classes 9 and 41 (DPMA or EUIPO) — [specs/done/new-name.md](specs/done/new-name.md). Own domain later, if the owner wants (`treniday.com` / `.app` were free on 2026-10-13).

## Ideas, open (the owner picks)

| Idea | Where |
|------|-------|
| App performance — measure, agree a budget, fix (owner, 2026-10-12) | [specs/performance.md](specs/performance.md) |
| "Support the author" (in-app purchase) — tax / legal set-up first | [research/support-the-author.md](research/support-the-author.md) |
| Rounded / oval frames for the exercise animations (owner: later) | — |
| iPad support with a wide layout (owner, 2026-10-13: after 1.0, which is iPhone only) | [platform.md § iOS specifics](reference/platform.md#ios-specifics) |
| Progress file: **built in 0.9.11**; open — offer to add the imported workouts to Apple Health / Health Connect (needs a workout read permission, changes the store's Health answers) | [specs/progress-export.md](specs/progress-export.md) |

**Parked or declined, do not propose:** the Telegram Mini App + bot ([research/telegram-mini-app.md](research/telegram-mini-app.md)); iPhone Safari haptics through the switch-checkbox trick; vibration patterns of our own ([research/vibration-patterns.md](research/vibration-patterns.md)); Rex, the streak monkey; a visit counter on the site (Search Console is enough); a redirect from the old `/caliday/` address — all the owner's, 2026-10-13 for the last four.

## Done ideas
