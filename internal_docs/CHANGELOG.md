# TreniDay — Changelog

One entry per version, newest first: what changed, what the owner decided, and the problems that were not obvious and how they were solved. What the user reads under the bell is in the ARB files (`releaseNotes<version>`); how things work now is in [reference/](reference/). Since 0.9.0 a version is one session branch, merged into `main` as one squash commit.

> Until 2026-10-12 the history was kept per session in `DEV_NOTES.md` (100+ entries); it was condensed into this file when the notes were reworked (owner: condense, drop the original — it stays in git history before 0.9.7).

## 0.9.11 — 2026-10-17 — Progress moves by a file, and adding one merges

Branch `session/2026-10-17-progress-export`.

**Settings → Your data** (owner's idea of 2026-10-13, [specs/done/progress-export.md](specs/done/progress-export.md)): "Save progress to a file" and "Add progress from a file" on every platform — to a new phone, or from the web version to the app. Adding a file **merges** it into what the device has: one history with the workouts of both, their SP, one streak over both devices' days, the further stage of each branch, every achievement, own routines, branches and courses of both; this device's settings stay. A confirmation lists what will change ("+4 workouts, +600 SP, Rank: Beginner → Amateur, Streak: 0 → 4 days, Push: stage 3, 3 new achievements: …"); a file with nothing new says so; the same file again changes nothing — [platform.md § Progress file](reference/platform.md#progress-file-0911), [progression.md § Progress merge](reference/progression.md#progress-merge-0911).
- **The owner's rule for a day trained on both devices** (2026-10-17): the first workout with more SP keeps its full SP; the other becomes a repeat (bonus) workout and its SP is counted again the way a repeat one earns it. The owner had first said to keep both as earned ("a little more is fine"), then changed it mid-build to this fair count.
- **The file:** JSON of our own (`ProgressFile`), enums by name, dates as the local time to the millisecond. A workout is known by the time it **ended** (the spec said "start": `_finishWorkout` writes `now` at the end) with its course and length. Hive keeps milliseconds while a log still in memory has microseconds — without cutting them, a workout exported right after training and imported back would have come in twice.
- **A newer app's file** is refused only for what this version cannot hold (a format version, branch, course, rank, set type or stage it does not know), not for its version number as the spec had it: the web build deploys with every merge and is usually ahead of the store app, so the main case, web → app, would have been refused. Unknown exercise and achievement ids are kept (old devices hold retired Friends achievements; the screens skip unknown ids).
- **The streak** is replayed from the merged days only when the file adds workouts, and never drops below what a device's profile knew of its last day (logs from before a field existed may not add up); the calendar's freeze marks follow the replay (a day filled in by the other device gives the freeze back).
- **Packages:** `share_plus` (on the web it falls back to a download by itself) and `file_selector` — flutter.dev's picker, chosen over `file_picker`, whose iOS pod carries photo-library code that the App Store asks purpose strings for. A computer's browser gets a plain download (`package:web`), a phone's the share sheet. On Android the picker shows every file: it filters by MIME type, and a JSON saved from a messenger often comes as `application/octet-stream`. Context7 was not available; the APIs were read from the packages' sources. The Android debug APK (AGP 8.11.1, although `share_plus` names 8.12.1) and the iOS simulator build compile.
- **Checked** in the web build: the download's name and content, the confirmation, Profile and Home after the merge without a restart, the same file again, a foreign file, a newer format. The browser pane cannot drive native pickers, so the file input and the download were stubbed in the page.
- The privacy policy has a "Progress file" part: the file holds the progress and goes only where the user sends it.
**Into Apple Health / Health Connect** (owner, 2026-10-17: "do Health, but check that there are no such workouts at that time"): after an import, when this device saves workouts to Health, a dialog offers to add the file's workouts there too; each one at a time when the store already has a workout of any app is skipped — [platform.md § Health Integration](reference/platform.md#health-integration).
- Reading workouts is new: `READ_EXERCISE` on Android (Play's Health Connect declaration gets a fourth justification, [store-listing.md](specs/store-listing.md#health-apps-declaration-and-health-connect)), workouts in the iOS read set (the purpose string rewritten in five languages); the privacy policy says when the times are read.
- The plugin's Android workout read also reads each session's distance, energy and steps; without read permissions for those (TreniDay asks for none) it returns an **empty list** — exactly what "no workouts there" looks like, so every workout would have been written twice. `MainActivity.kt` reads the sessions itself (`treniday/health` channel, `connect-client` added to the app with the plugin's version). Health Connect on Android 13 and lower reads no further back than 30 days and fails the whole read when asked for more: the import retries from 30 days ago and leaves older workouts out, saying so. A failed read writes nothing. On iOS a denied read cannot be told from an empty store (HealthKit hides it) — a known limit.
- **Found by the device test** (owner, 2026-10-17: "run the tests: two workouts on the web, the files into the iOS and Android emulators, check it all"): (1) the first build asked HealthKit to read workouts alone, and a HealthKit request keeps only what it asks for — the write was gone and Apple Health answered "not authorized"; every request now asks for the whole set. (2) HealthKit and Health Connect return the workouts that *start* in the range read, so a workout already going on was missed and a file's workout written beside it; the range now starts 12 h earlier. (3) On a tie of SP the merge kept "this device's" first workout, so Android and the iPhone kept different ones and each called the other's file "already here"; the tie now keeps the earlier one, and a workout that is the first one on either side takes part, which also brings such devices together. After the fixes the web, the iPhone and Android, each importing the others' files, ended up with the same seven workouts, SP, streak, branches and achievements; Apple Health got Functional Strength / Flexibility / Yoga and Health Connect Calisthenics / Yoga titled by course, none doubled.
- **Android had never written a workout to Health Connect:** every workout was sent as `TRADITIONAL_STRENGTH_TRAINING`, a type the plugin has on iOS only; on Android it threw and `writeWorkout` returned false silently. Found while checking which types each platform has.

**The kind of workout follows the course** (owner's question, 2026-10-17: "yoga is written as strength training too? maybe different types by course"): Calisthenics, own courses and routines → strength (Apple Health *Functional Strength Training* — bodyweight, not the weights of *Traditional* —, Health Connect *Calisthenics*); Healthy Body, Evening Stretch, Morning Routine → *Flexibility* (Health Connect: *Calisthenics*, the plugin cannot write *Stretching*); Yoga → *Yoga*. The calories follow the kind (MET 5.5 / 2.3 / 2.5 from the Compendium), and a Health Connect session is titled "TreniDay · <course>".

- The 0.9 line of the version history now reaches this release (a test checks it) and names the progress file.

## 0.9.10 — 2026-10-13 — Ready for the stores; Android testers wanted

Branch `session/2026-10-13-store-fixes`.

**What the stores check on upload** (found by the store-listing work: `specs/store-listing.md` § Before the first upload, PR #15) — [platform.md § iOS specifics, § Health Integration, § Android Specifics](reference/platform.md#ios-specifics); `test/repo/store_requirements_test.dart` keeps them from drifting:
- iOS: the Health prompts were Russian only — English in `Info.plist` now, translated in `<lang>.lproj/InfoPlist.strings` for the four app languages; `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false`; a privacy manifest for the app and the widget (UserDefaults through the App Group, `1C8F.1`; no tracking, no data collected).
- **iPhone only for 1.0** (owner: iPad later, recorded as an idea): `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = 1` everywhere, no iPad orientations. The Xcode project was edited with the `xcodeproj` gem of Homebrew's CocoaPods: the system Ruby lacks it, and Homebrew's Ruby 4 loads it only with the gems' `lib` folders on `RUBYLIB`. Checked in the built app: `UIDeviceFamily = [1]`, the four `.lproj` folders, a `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in the app and in the widget.
- Android: `USE_EXACT_ALARM` dropped (Play allows it only for alarm clocks and calendars; `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` stays and the reminders fall back to inexact alarms, as they already did); Health Connect's privacy-policy link opened Home on Android 14 and had no handler on Android 13 — `PermissionsRationaleActivity` hands the policy to the browser for both. Checked in the merged manifest of the APK.

**Android testers wanted** (owner: no 12 people with Android phones, no paid testers, no advertising — [decisions](decisions/README.md#ios-and-the-web-first-android-when-the-testers-gather-owner-2026-10-13)): the owner made the Google Group [treniday-testers](https://groups.google.com/g/treniday-testers); the site's FAQ ("Is there an app for iPhone and Android?") and About in the web version on an Android phone invite to join it. Its members become the closed testers once the Play account exists.
- Flutter's web engine takes the platform from `navigator.platform` before the user agent: a browser emulating an Android phone that keeps `MacIntel` (with touch points) is taken for an iPhone, so the invite was checked on a copy of the page with `navigator.platform` set as on a real phone (`Linux armv8l`). An Android phone asking for the desktop site reports Linux and gets no invite — fine.

## 0.9.9 — 2026-10-13 — CaliDay is now TreniDay

Branch `session/2026-10-13-treniday`.

**The new name** (owner: play with "training" and "day / daily" so that the name says daily workouts; Goro stays; first the name, then everything else). Of a checked shortlist the owner chose **TreniDay**, written with a capital D. The `caliday` domains were taken, and the checks found CALIDAY filed as a US trademark in class 41 (fitness training) by another company; TreniDay was free in every domain zone, store and register searched — the shortlist and the checks are in [specs/done/new-name.md](specs/done/new-name.md).

**Renamed everywhere at once** (owner: "absolutely everywhere", the repository too): every `CaliDay` / `caliday` in the tracked files became `TreniDay` / `treniday` by one script, and the paths with the name moved (`ios/TreniDayWidget/`, the Kotlin package folder, `design-system/treniday/`, the design documents). That covers:
- the app's name (iOS `CFBundleDisplayName` — it was "Caliday" with a small d —, the Android label, the web manifest and title, the launch screen), the texts that name the app in all four languages, and the "What's new" history;
- the Dart package (`package:treniday/…`; `hive_registrar.g.dart` and the l10n files regenerated, not edited);
- **the ids:** bundle / application id `com.pupptmstr.treniday` (the widget `com.pupptmstr.treniday.TreniDayWidget`), the App Group `group.com.pupptmstr.treniday`, the deep-link scheme `treniday://`, the iOS widget kinds `TreniDay…Widget`, the Android Today receiver `TreniDayWidgetReceiver`, the Xcode widget target and its folder. Nothing is in a store yet, so changing them costs nothing now and could not be done after the first release. On a test phone the renamed app installs as a new app beside the old one (the old one's data stays with it);
- the site (`pupptmstr.github.io/treniday/`, the og cards redrawn by `make_og.py`), the legal pages, the README, the LICENSE, the workflows (`--base-href /treniday/app/`, the release file names), the tools, the notes, the skills and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Left as they were: the git history, the local folder of the checkout, the Claude project memory's folder name (it follows the local path), and two lines of the 0.9.8 entry that speak about the old name itself.

**The web users keep their progress:** Hive on the web stores each box as an IndexedDB database of the origin `pupptmstr.github.io`, which the move from `/caliday/app/` to `/treniday/app/` does not change, and no box name contained the old name. The web build has no service worker, so no old copy stays cached.

**The repository and the address:** GitHub redirects a renamed repository (git, issues, links) but **not its Pages site** — `/caliday/` stops answering. The repository is renamed together with the merge, so the old address is down only until the new build deploys to `/treniday/`.

**After the merge** (branch `session/2026-10-13-search-console`, no app change): the site carries the Google Search Console verification tag of the owner's property `https://pupptmstr.github.io/treniday/`; the GitHub social preview (a custom image — the old CaliDay og card) is the owner's to replace with `site/og-en.png` (done). The owner verified the property, sent the sitemap and requested indexing; checked every workout sound of the 0.9.8 web version on an iPhone (all play); and dropped two ideas — own vibration patterns and Rex the streak monkey — as well as a visit counter on the site and a redirect from `/caliday/`.

**Store listings prepared** (branch `session/2026-10-13-store-listing`, no app change; owner: have both listings ready before the developer accounts exist, so that only the upload is left). The App Store and Google Play texts in the app's four languages are in `fastlane/metadata/` (deliver / supply layout), built from the site's texts and the README; the forms' answers, the native settings to change before the first upload and the screenshot plan are in [specs/store-listing.md](specs/store-listing.md). The site's FAQ got a seventh question with the contact email.
- **App Store keywords are counted in bytes**, not characters (App Store Connect help): 100 bytes hold about 50 Cyrillic letters, and umlauts and accents take two. `tools/store/check_listing.py` counts bytes and also guards the owner's rules (no minutes, no "free forever"), no price words in a name or title (Apple 2.3.7, Play's metadata policy), and that the iOS texts never name Android / Google and the Play texts never name the iPhone / Apple.
- **Apple's support URL must lead to contact information**, and the site had none (only the privacy policy has the email): hence the FAQ item; the support URL is the language's page + `#faq`.
- **The age rating is 9+ in Apple's 2025 system**: "Health or wellness topics" (exercise recommendations, calorie tracking) alone means 9+. Play: IARC 3+.
- **Data safety "No data collected or shared"**: writing to Health Connect is a transfer to another app on the device, which Play counts as sharing unless the user starts it or consents in a prominent disclosure — the opt-in switch and the system permission dialog do that. The conservative alternative is in the spec.
- **fastlane details:** deliver skips the release notes of an app's first version by itself and strips the files; supply sends a file as it is, so no listing file ends with a newline (the checker enforces it).
- **Found on the way, for a native follow-up** (not changed here): the iOS Health purpose strings are Russian only; `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` and a privacy manifest (the widget extension reads App Group `UserDefaults`, a required-reason API) are missing; `USE_EXACT_ALARM` is allowed on Play only for alarm-clock and calendar apps; Health Connect's link to the privacy policy opens Home, and Android 13 and lower need `ACTION_SHOW_PERMISSIONS_RATIONALE`. **The iPad:** the project declares iPad support, and in the iPad Pro 13-inch simulator the phone layout stretches across the whole width; a later version can add iPad support but never drop it, so iPhone only for 1.0 is recommended — the owner decides.

**Recorded for later:** progress export and import through a file — moving to a new phone, or from the web version to the app; the import **merges** with what the device has, never replaces it (owner) — [specs/done/progress-export.md](specs/done/progress-export.md).

## 0.9.8 — 2026-10-12 — A website; every workout sound in the web version on iPhone

Branch `session/2026-10-12-landing`.

**A landing page** (owner: a site that says what the app is, so that a search for "caliday" finds it, with the links to the web version, the stores and GitHub; styled like the app; in the app's languages): `https://pupptmstr.github.io/treniday/` — English at the root, `ru/`, `de/`, `es/` — deployed by `web.yml` together with the web app and the legal docs — [platform.md § Landing page](reference/platform.md#landing-page-098).
- One template and one strings file per language (`site/template.html`, `site/strings/<code>.json`) rendered by `tools/site/build_site.py`, which takes from the app what the site shares with it instead of keeping copies (the characters' SVGs, seven exercise animations and their crops, read from `animation_crops.dart`), and writes the hreflang links, `sitemap.xml` and the JSON-LD. A missing string fails the build.
- No screenshots: the two phones of the first screen are drawn in HTML with the app's tokens and play the real Lottie files, so every language has its own "screens". Driving the debug build in the simulator for a set of real screenshots per language was too slow to be worth it.
- The owner dropped "free forever": the site says "free", "no ads", "no tracking".
- Store links wait for the listings ("iPhone & Android — coming soon"; Apple's badge is only for an app that is on the App Store).
- `robots.txt` works only at a domain's root, so on `github.io/treniday/` the sitemap reaches Google through Search Console (the owner's step).
- An Actions deploy replaces the whole Pages site: the script writes into `_site/` next to the Jekyll output without clearing it, and keeps out of Jekyll's `assets/` folder (`img/`, `anim/`).

**Every workout sound in the web version on iPhone** (the owner heard only some cues on the phone, no ticks): audioplayers' web player makes a new `<audio>` element (with an AudioContext of its own) for every play and drops it when it ends; iOS Safari lets an element start only inside a tap, so every cue the timer starts stayed silent and only Pause / Skip were heard. The guess that a sound had no time to finish was not it (a tick is 70 ms, one a second). Now the web build decodes every cue once and plays it on one Web Audio context (`WebCuePlayer`), unlocked by the first tap anywhere in the app — [workout.md § SoundService](reference/workout.md).
- Checked in Chromium: one running context, the start cue and the five countdown ticks a second apart, no media element. The iPhone itself is the owner's check after the deploy.
- Web Audio on iOS follows the silent switch and mixes with the music; the owner keeps it so (2026-10-12, [decisions](decisions/README.md)).

**The GitHub repository presented** (owner: "the repository is not dressed up"): the README opens with the icon, the tagline, the links to the website and the web app, the CI and deploy badges and the six characters; its numbers were refreshed (24 branches, 155 exercises). A stray `--help` file in the root (an HTML fragment a tool wrote there in 0.9.5) is gone. On GitHub: the About description, the website link and 20 topics; the empty Wiki and Projects tabs are off. A `LICENSE` file says what the README and the Terms of Use already did: the source is open to read, all rights reserved (the owner first picked GPL-3.0, then chose to keep the policies as written).

**Recorded for later:** a new name for the app (owner, not urgent: `caliday.com` and `.app` are taken; no other app with the name was found) — [specs/done/new-name.md](specs/done/new-name.md).

## 0.9.7 — 2026-10-12 — Widgets with Goro; Flutter 3.47; the notes reworked

Branch `session/2026-10-12-widgets-notes-deps`.

**Home-screen widgets redone** (idea of 2026-10-10; the owner chose the set and the look on an HTML mock-up with Goro's real art: the brand-blue background, a dark ember for the Streak, a new pose every day, a night sky while Goro sleeps): Today (small / medium / large; the day's plan or done, the week, the way to the next rank), Goro (his face by the mood of the day), Streak, Rank; on iOS also four lock-screen widgets (rectangular Today, circular Streak and Rank, the inline line). Each opens its place (`treniday://workout | home | calendar | profile`). See [platform.md § Home-screen widgets](reference/platform.md#home-screen-widgets-097).
- The data is one pure snapshot (`WidgetSnapshot`), every text from the ARB files; the widgets decide by the moment they render with the app's rules mirrored in Swift and Kotlin (done today, the streak after midnight, the mood by the hour, the pose of the day). The old `workoutDoneToday` flag went stale at midnight; now the snapshot carries days.
- Goro's art for the widgets is rendered from the app's SVGs by `tools/characters/export_widget_art.py` (headless Chrome, the tile removed, cropped to the figure). An empty placeholder path (`M0,0`) in the sleeping face pulled the crop box to the corner: the box is measured over visible shapes only.
- iOS: a `WidgetBundle` of four kinds; the old kind `TreniDayWidget` is the Today widget, so a placed widget keeps working. A radial glow with a fixed radius showed a square edge in a smaller frame — it now fades out at the inscribed circle.
- Android: four providers, Today and Rank resizable with a layout per size (`RemoteViews` size map on 12+). `adb` cannot send `APPWIDGET_UPDATE` (protected broadcast), and a force-stopped app shows placeholders; checking states was done through the app (debug options, then leaving the app).
- "Done · +0 SP" for a day without SP became just "Done".

**Flutter 3.41.9 → 3.47.7** (go_router 18 needs Flutter 3.44+), pinned in the three workflows; **major upgrades**: go_router 18, flutter_local_notifications 22, home_widget 0.10, package_info_plus 10, plus minor ones (riverpod 3.4, audioplayers 6.8, app_links 7.2, intl 0.20.3). One deprecation (`SliverReorderableList.onReorder` → `onReorderItem`, which already adjusts the index). intl 0.20.3 (CLDR 47) joins the year and «г.» with a narrow no-break space — a test with the literal failed.
- **Xcode 27 refuses deployment targets below 15**: the app and the widget go to iOS 16, the Podfile raises every pod below it. Flutter 3.47 moved the iOS plugins to Swift Package Manager by itself.
- **HealthKit and the App Group checked in the simulator** (the Health permission sheet, the widget reading what the app writes). A real device needs the owner's Apple ID in Xcode.
- A local Android build needs JDK 17 / 21: Android Studio bundles Java 25, which Gradle 8.14 cannot run, and Flutter prefers it over `JAVA_HOME`.

**The notes reworked** (with the owner: a folder by topic, a changelog by version, English): `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `DEV_NOTES.md` became [README.md](README.md) (index and rules), [STATUS.md](STATUS.md), this file, `reference/` (nine topic files), `decisions/`, `specs/`, `research/`. The session history was condensed here.

**Recorded for later:** performance work on the app as a separate effort (owner) — [specs/performance.md](specs/performance.md).

## 0.9.6 — 2026-10-12 — A sound for every moment; own courses only; full-width sheets

- **Sounds redone** (idea of 2026-10-10): 21 cues synthesised by `tools/sounds/gen_sounds.py` (WAV, one family of timbres in C major), a pure cue chooser over the workout state machine, Settings → Sounds all / key only / off (`UserProfile.soundModeName`, HiveField 28). The owner kept everything as drafted; the countdown has 5 ticks, the last higher.
- **The cues stopped the user's music:** audioplayers' default context asks for audio focus; every player now gets `AudioContextConfig(focus: mixWithOthers)` (on Android the global context only reaches players created after it, so it is set per player).
- **Own courses only:** one ticked course of any kind is enough (before, one built-in course always stayed). `activeCourseIds` may be empty; `enrolledCoursesProvider` falls back to Calisthenics when nothing is left.
- **Bottom sheets span the screen** up to 640 px: Material 3 only caps the width and `BottomSheet` loosens it, so a sheet of short centred lines shrank to its text.
- Haptics: Flutter has only preset impacts; patterns of our own need a package (open idea). iPhone Safari haptics through the hidden switch-checkbox trick were declined by the owner — only real taps tick since iOS 26.5.

## 0.9.5 — 2026-10-11 — Friends removed; the host greets you by name; four branches outside the courses

- **Friends removed** (owner: without a server a one-off QR / Bluetooth swap added little and cost a lot): screens, model, codecs, BLE service, four packages, the camera and Bluetooth permissions, the privacy-policy sections. typeId 9 and UserProfile fields 17 / 23 are retired; the `friends` box is deleted at start-up, not awaited (on the web a database an old tab holds blocks the delete). An old `treniday://friend` link opens Home.
- **The name is used:** a greeting by the part of the day above the host's line on Home, the Profile header, the summary title, Settings → Profile.
- **Strong Back, Glutes, Arms & Shoulders, Cardio** — branches outside every course (BranchId HiveFields 20–23), 22 exercises with animations (`gen_extra.py`), picked in the course builder; `all_complete` counts only the courses' branches. `CourseCatalog.courseOf` threw for a branch no course lists; it returns null (Goro presents those achievements).
- Animation lessons: Goro's proportions (legs 84 px, arms 80 px, torso 100 px) dictated the props (a low sofa, the feet past the door post); the owner allowed other proportions for the pike push-ups (`sc_len`); a leg in line with the body has the angle `br`, not `br + 180`.

## 0.9.4 — 2026-10-10 — The middle of Home; the plan in the workout button; animations everywhere

- **Home** (the owner picked from options A–F on mock-ups): before the first workout the host's line, an open challenge, the next goals, the branches; after it the history and "Progress today". The plan folds into the workout button behind a narrow arrow strip. To show growth, each workout stores how every branch moved (`WorkoutLog.growth`, `BranchGrowth`, typeId 14).
- **Each host speaks in its own voice**, four lines per mood, never the same twice in a row; a host may use its own gender, the user is never gendered.
- **Exercise animations wherever an exercise is named** (`ExerciseThumb`), cropped to the figure by `tools/lottie/thumb_crops.py` (the 400 × 400 canvases leave the figure small; the square may reach past the canvas edge).
- **Owner's feedback on 0.9.3:** own courses in the "+" list (hide / show, edit; `CustomCourse.shown`), an own-course mark on the pill, every host holding a locked medal for an achievement still ahead, Goro's fun poses on About (`gen_goro.py`: the idle's head and torso, IK capsule limbs).
- `main` got a ruleset: PRs only, squash merges only, CI required.

## 0.9.3 — 2026-10-09 — The course builder; "What's new" with the whole history

- **Own courses** from built-in branches (progress shared) and **own branches** made of catalog exercises in the user's order, amounts and norms derived (`CustomStages`). `CourseId` / `BranchId` are Hive enums, so runtime types sit beside them (`Branch`, `Course`, keys `push` / `custom_<id>`); the built-in path keeps its data exactly. `PlannedExercise.branchKey` says which progress an exercise moves (a stage copy keeps its catalog `branch`).
- **"What's new"**: the 6 newest versions in full, a folded history of every minor line 0.1 … 0.9 (versions before 2026-04-22 were numbered 1.x; no footnote, owner).
- Lessons: `SkillProgress extends HiveObject` already has `key` (hence `branchKey`); a `FilledButton` in a `Row` needs its own `minimumSize` (the theme's is infinite width).

## 0.9.2 — 2026-10-09 — The small things; every exercise animated

- The three longest per-side holds halved to 10 → 30 s per side; stored progress above a target is capped at start-up (`runMigrations`).
- The course hosts present the achievements of their branches (`courseOf(branch, active:)` for a shared branch).
- The theme switch: `SegmentedButton` ignores padding on segments with icons (flutter#173944) — the icon moved into the label.
- The pigeon pose from above and 90/90 from the front (legs solved in 3D) — 133 of 133 exercises animated.
- A stale incremental Kotlin build in `build/<plugin>/` reported a plugin's own classes as unresolved: delete that folder, not all of `build/`.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-10-09 — Yoga with Miso the cat

- Standing, Equilibrium, Backbends, Flow and the shared Calisthenics Balance (courses may share branches, owner 2026-10-08); 21 stage exercises, 18 new animations (`gen_yoga.py`: sun salutations as interpolated key poses re-planted by IK every frame); Miso drawn.
- Goro's arm is shorter than his hip-to-shoulder: a hand reaches a foot behind him only with the heel high (dancer, bow searched numerically); lying on the back, a spine bend that lifts the hips is negative.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-08 — Morning Routine with Aurora the lark

- Spine, Joints, Arms, Energy — standing, quiet, no jumps; 22 animations (`gen_morning.py`), Aurora drawn (on Luna's template she read as an owl).
- The owner's rule from the review: **never draw a limb segment longer than it is** (an elbow placed at the knee stretched the arm).
- Fast sweeps need angle-driven arms and ≥ 22 frames to stay under the checker's 22 px / frame.

## 0.8.20 — 2026-10-08 — Evening Stretch; holds on each side; a host for every course

- **Evening Stretch** with Luna the owl (Back, Hips, Folds, Shoulders; 19 animations, a seated front view in the rig); a bonus workout of it adds no supplementary exercises.
- **Holds on each side**, hands-free: side 1 → "switch sides" countdown → side 2; the weaker side is the result; SP counts both.
- **Course hosts** (Raffi, Luna; later Aurora and Miso): the active course's host is the face of Home and the Profile; Goro stays the face of the app. **Skala redrawn as a real bull** (a lone digit from the middle of a fist can read as a rude gesture — a rule in BRAND.md).
- Throwaway content tables generate the catalog, ARB keys and lookups together, so ids and languages cannot drift.

## 0.8.19 — 2026-10-07 — Each branch moves on once a day, in any workout

- Owner's rule: a branch progresses at most once per calendar day, on the first successful set of its current stage, in any workout (`ProgressionService.applyDailyResult`, `SkillProgress.lastProgressedOn`). SP and the streak keep their rules. The same gate closed a bug: an exercise of another stage moved the current one.
- Friends stopped carrying branch progress (QR format 3) so a new branch could never break the exchange.

## 0.8.18 — 2026-10-07 — The widget in the app's language

- The widget's "Done" and the iOS gallery text were hard-coded Russian. The app hands over every text (native resources would follow the system language); a test keeps the Swift and Kotlin keys in step. A language change reschedules notifications and refreshes the widget at once.

## 0.8.17 — 2026-10-07 — Numbers agree with their words

- Counted messages became plurals in every language ("1 sets", «5 раза», «1 друзей»); an amount and its unit are one message (`workoutAmountReps(n)`), never a number glued to a separate unit word.

## 0.8.16 — 2026-10-07 — Any number of languages; German and Spanish drafts

- One list of languages (`appLanguages`), `l10nFor` for texts without a context, notification and widget texts moved into the ARB files, tests that loop over every ARB file; `CFBundleLocalizations` declared on iOS. German and Spanish as drafts for native proofreading.
- `no_hardcoded_text_test` failed on Windows (`\` paths); fixed.

## 0.8.10 – 0.8.15 — 2026-10-06 … 07 — Hands-free holds; honest time; "What's new"

- **0.8.15** — the bell in the Profile with "What's new" (`UserProfile.lastSeenReleaseVersion`, a test forces a note for every version bump); the "built with" line removed from About.
- **0.8.14** — the estimate on "Again" too: the bonus workout's supplementary pair is seeded by the day and the count of workouts, so Home and the workout screen build the same plan.
- **0.8.13** — the estimate learns the user's pace: the median of real / estimated over the last 7 workouts, clamped 0.6–1.6 (`WorkoutLog.estimatedDurationSec`).
- **0.8.12** — "Today's workout (≈ N min)" from the real plan; the evening notification no longer promises minutes (a test forbids it).
- **0.8.11** — workout size Short / Standard / Full instead of "5 / 10 / 15 minutes", which was never a duration (the stored code is unchanged).
- **0.8.10** — a get-ready countdown replaces the Start button of timed holds (0.8.9 had added the button; a tap between rest and hold breaks a hands-free workout). Also: hard-coded strings moved to l10n, a guard against hard-coded English, the exercise search in every language.

## 0.8.8 – 0.8.9 — 2026-10-06 — CI; tests; DST

- **CI** on every push and PR (l10n drift, analyze, test, debug Android build); the web deploy waits for the tests; the release workflow drafted and disabled until the store accounts exist.
- **400+ tests** (they found two crashes and two data gaps); plugin-bound decisions extracted into pure functions (`NotificationPlanner` and others).
- **Day arithmetic across DST** was wrong in several places (a local day is 23 / 25 h): everything goes through `core/utils/calendar_days.dart`.
- Challenge norms for the six hardest final stages; the web QR scanner explains camera errors.

## 0.8.0 – 0.8.7 — 2026-05-02 … 10-06 — Calendar, rank decay, the web version, generated animations

- Interactive Home stats (streak → calendar, SP → history, rank → info); a workout calendar with a heatmap.
- Rank decay: display-only, after 21 / 35 / 45 / 53 / 59 days, a warning at 14.
- **The web build** (PWA on GitHub Pages, Hive on IndexedDB, native features guarded by `kIsWeb`), deployed with the legal pages by one workflow.
- **Animations authored in code** (`tools/lottie`: a Goro paper-doll rig with FK / IK, later front, top and back views): Flex, the supplementary pool, Posture, Neck, the cat-cow; the oldest designer files reviewed and Pull / Push s4–s7 redrawn.

## 0.7 (was 1.7) — 2026-04-07 … 09 — Own workouts; the library; legal pages

- Custom routines and the quick routine by focus; the exercise library with tags and search (0.6); the privacy policy and terms of use on GitHub Pages; `docs/` became the public folder, `internal_docs/` the internal one.
- Hive → Hive CE, Riverpod 3 (`Notifier` everywhere), 11 packages upgraded.
- On 2026-04-22 every version was renumbered 1.x → 0.x: v1.0 is the first public release.

## 0.5 (was 1.5) — 2026-04-04 … 06 — Courses

- Calisthenics and Healthy Body (Posture, Neck), the Library tab, course selection in the onboarding; branch progress shared across courses (it was per course at first — a bug, a branch is one skill); Flexibility; the supplementary pool; Legs animations.

## 0.4 (was 1.4) — 2026-03-22 … 28 — Friends (removed in 0.9.5)

- QR and Bluetooth exchange of profiles (the BLE peripheral and GATT server came in March); the onboarding asks the name; HealthKit fixed (the entitlement was missing); the iOS widget target registered in the project; the documentation went English-only.

## 0.3 — 2026-03-05 — Widget and Health

- The first home-screen widget (2×2, then 4×2; Glance crashed without the Compose compiler plugin, so `AppWidgetProvider` + RemoteViews); Apple Health / Health Connect.

## 0.2 — 2026-03-02 … 04 — Sound, history, three tabs

- Sound and haptics, the workout history, the three-tab Home, streak freezes, About.

## 0.1 — 2026-02-25 … 03-01 — The first version

- Short daily workouts with SP, streaks, ranks and reminders; Push, Core, Pull, Legs, Balance with stage progression and the Challenge (Skala); achievements, bonus workouts, the dark theme, Russian and English; Goro's six moods; the first Push animations.
